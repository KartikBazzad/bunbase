# BunKMS (Key Management Service)

BunKMS is the centralized "Root of Trust" for the BunBase ecosystem. It provides secure key management, encryption-as-a-service, and secret storage.

## Features

- **Key Management**: Create, Rotate, and Revoke cryptographic keys (AES-256, RSA).
- **Crypto Operations**: Encrypt/Decrypt data without exposing keys to applications (Envelope Encryption).
- **Secure Storage**: All keys are encrypted at rest using a Master Verification Key.
- **Audit Logging**: Immutable history of all key operations.

## Architecture

See [Implementation Plan](../planning/bun_kms.md).

## Getting Started
